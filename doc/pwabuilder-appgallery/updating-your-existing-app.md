5.	Build your package.

**Please note**

If you do not want to use PWABuilder to sign your Android package, you can use **Other Android** tab to generate the unsigned PWA APK, then manually sign it yourself using your own keystore.

[PWABuilder](https://www.pwabuilder.com/) will build a package signed with your existing key. When you upload it to Huawei AppGallery, itâ€™ll automatically be recognized as a new version of your existing app.
